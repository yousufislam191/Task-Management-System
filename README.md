<h1 align="center">Run this web application on your local server</h1>
<p align="center">Here is the step-by-step guideline that will help you run this project on your local server.</p>

1. **Open your terminal and clone the repository using this command**

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/yousufislam191/Task-Management-System.git
```

2. **After cloning, you will see a folder which name is `Task-Management-System`. Open this foler using vs code. After opening, you will see there are two folders which will be `client` and `server`.**

---

3. **For running front-end site, open your terminal in your vs code and run this three command**

```terminal
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. **You will get to show a URL where the front-end site is running, then open this link in your browser.**

---

5. _Now it's time to run the backend site, and there are some steps for running the backend site, and you have to follow these steps **strictly**; otherwise, you will face some errors._
6. **Open a new terminal in your vs code then run this two command.**

```terminal
cd server
npm install
```

7. **Go to your email to create `SMTP App Password` or by clicking [here][1], or you can watch this [video][2] to understand the better way. After creating the password, you have to save this password in your notepad for later uses because you will never get it after closing the window.**

[2]: https://youtu.be/qpAI5qZR9ms?si=mlC-cNmT4gs5riMf "Youtube Video"

8. **After that, create a new file in your root folder of the `server` folder which name will be `.env`, or you will be able to see a `.env.example` file, where you can set the environment variable by removin `.example` from the `.env.example`.**
9. **Inside the `.env` file, you have to store some of your environment variables. Your environment variables must be exactly the same format. For example, `APP_NAME= Task Management System`. All environment variables are named below:**
